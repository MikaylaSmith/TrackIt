# TrackIt
The code behind the TrackIt Web Application for creating, editing and deletion of data as entered by users. 

# What is TrackIt?
TrackIt is a simple web application designed to help with keeping track of one of three types of logs:
  - Education and Student information logs.
  - Journal Entries
  - Budget Entries
Each user's account can access one of these at a time. User's then have free reign to enter whatever information they need to in order to record the information they want.

# Using TrackIt - User Information
When using TrackIt, everything is tied to the user's account, in particular, the type of access that the user sets for themselves. One type of log is available at a time, but this can be altered by the user, if desired. 

# Using TrackIt - Education and Student Logs
When a user's account has access to students and education logs, the user can create as many students as they want. Once a student is created (this must be done first), the user can create logs based on sessions with that student, recording the date, the school the student attends at the time of the session, the grade level of the student during the session, the time spent in the session, and any notes that the user wants to make about the session. Only one log may be made at a time but can be edited or even deleted if desired. Be advised: there is NO way to recover edited or deleted information. The same goes for the student's information, which also can be edited and deleted at any point in time. 

# Using TrackIt - Journal Entries
When a user's account has access to journal entries, the user can create as many entries as they want. When a user wants to create a new journal entry, they only must include a title and any amount of text for the notes. Only one entry may be made at a time but can be edited or even deleted if desired. Be advised: there is NO way to recover edited or deleted information. 

# Using TrackIt - Budget Entries
When a user's account has access to budget entries, the user can create as many entries as they want. The entries are organized by store name, so when a new entry is to be created, the user can choose the name of an already existing store or can select "Other" and enter the new one. Other information entered includes the date and how much money was spent at that store. The total amount spent at the store can be accessed by navigating to the "Budget Totals" tab. Only one entry may be made at a time but can be edited or even deleted if desired. Be advised: there is NO way to recover edited or deleted information.
